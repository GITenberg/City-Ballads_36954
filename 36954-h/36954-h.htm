<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>When city people go among forests and hills, they drink in the fresh
air and weird scenery of rural surroundings, with much more relish,
enjoyment, and appreciation, than do the life-long residents they
find there.</p>

<p>For the same reason, the great drama of metropolitan existence falls
most forcibly upon those just from the clear streams and green
meadows of the country. Their impressions then are deeper, and their
feelings more intense than if they were city born and bred.</p>

<p>With the latter fact in view, this book is an effort to reproduce
some of the effects of city scenes and character upon the intellect
and imagination of two people from the country:</p>

<p>First, a young student, who has travelled the well-beaten roads of a
college course, but is just entering real life, and now for the
first time walks the paved and palace-bordered streets of which he
has heard and read so much.</p>

<p>Second, an old farmer, with very little "book-learning," but a clear
brain, a warm heart, and independent judgment, and a habit of
philosophizing upon everything he sees, which habit he brings to the
city, and applies to the strange facts he witnesses.</p>

<p>These, with certain incidental thoughts and characters encountered
and discussed, constitute the present work. It will be found, as
intended, sketchy and suggestive rather than elaborate and complete.
Note-books and diaries are designed, not so much for the history of
a career or an event, as a light to the memory, a stimulus to the
imagination, and a help to the heart.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>It is the hope of the author that his book may perform those offices
for you, his readers, and that it will rouse your pity of pain, your
enjoyment of honest mirth, your hatred of sham and wrong, and your
love and adoration of the Resolute and the Good, and their winsome
child, the Beautiful.</p>

<p>In which case he shakes hands with his large and loved constituency,
and continues happy.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Here in The City I ponder,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Through its long pathways I wander.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">These are the spires that were gleaming<br /></span>
<span class="i4">All through my juvenile dreaming.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This is The Something I heard, far away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When, at the close of a tired Summer day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Resting from work on the lap of a lawn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gazing to whither The Sun-god had gone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leaving behind him his mantles of gold&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This is The Something by which I was told;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">"Bend your head, dreamer, and listen&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Come to my splendors that glisten!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Either to triumph they call you,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Or to what worst could befall you!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This is The Something that thrilled my desires,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the weird Morning had kindled his fires,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the gray city of clouds in the east<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lighted its streets as for pageant or feast,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Whisp'ring&mdash;my spirit elating&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">"Come to me, boy, I am waiting!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bring me your muscle and spirit and brain&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here to my glory-strewn, ruin-strewn plain!"<br /></span></div>

<span class="i2">In the barns toiling and singing,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Breath of a hay-meadow smelling,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Forest-trees loving and felling&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where'er my spirit was turning,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Lived that mysterious yearning!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When in the old country school-house I conned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Legends of life in the broad world beyond&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When in the trim hamlet-college I cast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wondering glances at days that were past&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ever I longed for the walls and the streets,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the rich conflict that energy meets!<br /></span>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Cousin John:</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We got here safe&mdash;my worthy wife an' me&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An' put up at James Sunnyhopes'&mdash;a pleasant place to be;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An' Isabel, his oldest girl, is home from school just now,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An' pets me with her manners all her young man will allow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An' his good wife has monstrous sweet an' culinary ways:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is a summery place to pass a few cold winter days.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Besides, I've various cast-iron friends in different parts o' town,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That's always glad to have me call whenever I come down;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But t'other day, when 'mongst the same I undertook to roam,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I could not find a single one that seemed to be to home!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An' when I asked their whereabouts, the answer was, "I think,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If you're a-goin' down that way, you'll find 'em at the Rink."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I asked what night the Lyceum folks would hold their next debate&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(I've sometimes gone an' helped 'em wield the cares of Church an' State),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">An' if protracted meetin's now was holdin' anywhere<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(I like to get my soul fed up with fresh celestial fare);<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or when the next church social was; they'd give a knowin' wink,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An' say, "I b'lieve there's nothin' now transpirin' but the Rink."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"What is this 'Rink?'" I innocent inquired, that night at tea.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Oh, you must go," said Isabel, "this very night with me!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Mrs. Stebbins she must go, an' skate there with us, too!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My wife replied, "My dear, just please inform me when I do.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But you two go." An' so we went, an' saw a circus there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With which few sights I've ever struck will anyways compare.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">It seems a good-sized meetin'-house had given up its pews<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(The church an' pastor had resigned, from spiritual blues),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An' several acres of the floor was made a skatin' ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where folks of every shape an' size went skippin' round an' round;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An' in the midst a big brass band was helpin' on the fun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An' everything was gay as sixteen weddin's joined in one.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I've seen small insects crazy-like go circlin' through the air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An' wondered if they thought some time they'd maybe get somewhere;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I've seen a million river-bugs go scootin' round an' round,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An' wondered what 'twas all about, or what they'd lost or found;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But men an' women, boys an' girls, upon a hard-wood floor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All whirlin' round like folks possessed, I never saw before.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">An' then it straight came back to me, the things I'd read an' heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">About the rinks, an' how their ways was wicked an' absurd;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'd learned somewhere that skatin' wasn't a healthy thing to do&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But there was Doctor Saddlebags&mdash;his fam'ly with him, too!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'd heard that 'twasn't a proper place for Christian folks to seek&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Old Deacon Perseverance Jinks flew past me like a streak!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then Sister Is'bel Sunnyhopes put on a pair o' skates,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An' started off as if she'd run through several different States.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My goodness! how that gal showed up! I never did opine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That she could twist herself to look so charmin' an' so fine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then a fellow that she knew took hold o' hands with her,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sort o' double crossways like, an' helped her, as it were.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>I</i> used to skate; an' 'twas a sport of which I once was fond.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why, I could write my autograph on Tompkins' saw-mill pond.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of course to slip on runners, that is one thing, one may say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An' movin' round on casters is a somewhat different way;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when the fun that fellow had came flashin' to my eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I says, "I'm young again; by George, I'll skate once more or die!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A little boy a pair o' skates to fit my boots soon found&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He had to put 'em on for me (I weigh three hundred pound);<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An' then I straightened up an' says, "Look here, you younger chaps,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You think you're runnin' some'at past us older heads, perhaps.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If this young lady here to me will trust awhile her fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'll go around a dozen times an' show you how to skate."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She was a niceish, plump young gal, I'd noticed quite a while,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An' she reached out her hands with 'most too daughterly a smile;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But off we pushed with might an' main; when all to once the wheels<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Departed suddenly above, an' took along my heels;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My head assailed the floor as if 'twas tryin' to get through,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An' all the stars I ever saw arrived at once in view.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Twas sing'lar (as not quite unlike a saw-log there I lay)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How many of the other folks was goin' that same way;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They stumbled over me in one large animated heap,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An' formed a pile o' legs an' arms not far from ten foot deep;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But after they had all climbed off, in rather fierce surprise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I lay there like a saw-log still&mdash;considerin' how to rise.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then, dignified I rose, with hands upon my ample waist,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An' then sat down again with large and very painful haste;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An' rose again, and started off to find a place to rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then on my gentle stomach stood, an' tore my meetin' vest;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Sister Sunnyhopes slid up as trim as trim could be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An' she an' her young fellow took compassionate charge o' me.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then after I'd got off the skates an' flung 'em out o' reach,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I rose, while all grew hushed an' still, an' made the followin' speech:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"My friends, I've struck a small idea (an' struck it pretty square),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which physic'ly an' morally will some attention bear:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">As they would have done if streets could die;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sidewalks stretched as quietly prone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if a foot they had never known;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And not a cottage within the town,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But looked as if it would fain lie down.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Away in the west a stacken-cloud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With white arms drooping and bare head bowed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was leaning against&mdash;with drowsy eye&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dark blue velveting of the sky.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">His fourth wife slumbering by his side.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The parson visioned his Sunday's text,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Still studying, as he partly slept,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How men might glutton, and tope, and fly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the face of Death, and still not die;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lawyer dreamed that his clients meant<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To club together, and then present,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As proof that their faith had not grown dim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A small bright silver hatchet to him;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And people holding, in free easy style,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A Fourth-of-July picnic all the while.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thousands were eating there amid the din,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As though they'd hardly time to do it in;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thousands were loitering in the breezy air,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The ocean, to my unaccustomed view,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seemed having quite a lively picnic too;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The waves came slamming at us with a roar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And chased each other pell-mell to the shore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in these waves, and adding to the noise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A lot of men and women, girls and boys,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dressed in a style that made my good wife frown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like big-sized corks went bobbing up and down.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some glided out and in, like jumping-jacks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some rode the waves&mdash;a-lying on their backs;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And some&mdash;as decent folks as one could see&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made capers that were very queer to see.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I noticed Miss Doozéll, much versed in books,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And quite particular about her looks,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Each with his tiny shovel and his pail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each working his own little piece of land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And making small plantations in the sand!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And would have shown capacity to shirk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If they had known how much it looked like work.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Like an old-fashioned horse-power&mdash;larger, though,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And worked by steam; and on the sweeps one finds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Big wooden animals of different kinds:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And on these beasts, sixteen times round or more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rode children of from fifty down to four,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While some big-sized hand-organ filled the air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With crack-voiced music, plenty and to spare.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here a big premium cow&mdash;quite dead, alas!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gave milkman's milk-and-water by the glass;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here were some great "museums," which consisted<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of wondrous things that never have existed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There omnibuses hover on your track,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ready to draw you somewhere else&mdash;and back;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here "marine railroads," as you onward plod,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will take you riding at five cents a rod;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This "elevator" lifts you pretty high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shows you men must look small from the sky;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yon gambling den will send you from its door,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poorer and not much wiser than before;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That fellow there will, in an ocean view,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your picture take, and swear that it is you.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yes, every trap that ever caught a dime,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is ready set and baited, all the time!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And sometimes everything seems blurred, indeed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With man's surprising wickedness and greed,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">We got here safe&mdash;my worthy wife and me&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And took a tent here in the woods contigious to the sea;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We've harvested such means of grace as growed within our reach&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We've been to several meetings here, and heard the Bishop preach;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And everything went easy like until we took a whim&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My wife and I&mdash;one breezy day, to take an ocean swim.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We shouldn't have ventured on't, I think, if Sister Sunnyhopes<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And told how soothing it would be "in ocean rills to lave,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And "sport within the bounding surf," and "ride the crested wave;"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so we went along with her&mdash;my timid wife and me&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two inland noodles, for our first acquaintance with the sea.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They put me in a work-day rig, as usually is done&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A wampus and short overalls all sewed up into one.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I had to pull and tug and shrink to make the thing go 'round<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(You are aware my peaceful weight will crowd three hundred pound).<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They took my wig and laid it up&mdash;to keep it dry, they said&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And strapped a straw-stack of a hat on my devoted head.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They put my wife into a frock too short by full a third:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas somewhat in the Bloomer style&mdash;I told her 'twas absurd!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">You know she's rather long and slim&mdash;somewhat my opposite&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And clothes that was not made for her is likely not to fit;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But as we was we vent'red in&mdash;my timid wife and me&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And formed our first acquaintance with the inconsistent sea.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And Wife came third, a-looking scared, scarce knowing what to do.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Sister Sunnyhopes a smile of virgin sweetness gave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And said, "Now watch your chance, and jump&mdash;here comes a <i>lovely</i> wave!"<br /></span>

<span class="i0">I must have jumped, I rather think, the wrong time of the moon;<br /></span>

<h3><br /><br />[THE BOY CONVICT'S STORY.]</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I'd rather sit here, Mr. Sheriff&mdash;up near to the end of the car;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We won't do so much advertising if we stay in the seat where we are.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That sweet little dude saw the bracelets that you on my wrists have bestowed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tells the new passengers promptly you're "taking me over the road."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I've had a well-patronized trial&mdash;the neighbors all know of my fall;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when I get out among strangers I'm sensitive-like, after all.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For I was a lad of good prospects, some three or four summers ago&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There wasn't any boy in our township who made a more promising show!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I learned all of Solomon's proverbs, and took in their goodness and worth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till I felt like a virtue-hooped barrel, chock-full of the salt of the earth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And this precious picnic of sorrow would likely enough have been saved,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If I had had less of a heart, sir, or home had contained what it craved.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For the time when a boy is in danger of walking a little bit wild,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is when he's too young to be married&mdash;too old to be known as a child;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A bird in the lonely grass thickets, just out of the parent tree thrown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too large to be kept in the old nest&mdash;too small to have one of his own;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When, desolate 'mid his companions, his soul is a stake to be won;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis then that the Devil stands ready to get a good chance to catch on!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh, yes! I'd a good enough home, sir, so far as the house was concerned;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My parents were first-class providers&mdash;I ate full as much as I earned.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My clothes were all built of good timber, and fit every day to be seen;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There wasn't any lock on the pantry&mdash;my bedroom was tidy and clean;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And taking the home up and down, sir, I'd more than an average part,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With one quite important exception&mdash;<i>there wasn't any room for my heart</i>.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The house couldn't have been any colder, with snow-drifts in every room!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The house needn't have been any darker to make a respectable tomb!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I used to stop short on the door-step, and brace up a minute or more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bid a good-bye to the sunshine, before I would open the door;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I used to feed daily on icebergs&mdash;take in all the freeze I could hold&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then go out and warm in the sunshine, because my poor heart was so cold!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And hadn't I a father and mother? Oh yes! just as good as they make&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Too</i> good, I have often suspected (though maybe that last's a mistake).<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But they'd travelled so long and so steady the way to Perfection's abode,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They hadn't any feeling for fellows who could not as yet find the road;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so, till some far advanced mile-post on goodness's pike I could win,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They thought of me, not as their own child, but as one of the children of sin.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And hadn't I brothers and sisters? Oh yes! till they somewhat had grown;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, shivering, they went off and left me to stand the cold weather alone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For I had the luck to be youngest&mdash;the last on the family page,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The one to prop up the old roof-tree&mdash;the staff of my parents' old age;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who well understood all the uses to which a mere staff is applied;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They used me whenever convenient&mdash;then carelessly threw me aside!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And hadn't I any associates? Oh yes! I had friends, more or less,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But seldom I asked them to visit our house with the slightest success;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whenever the project was mentioned, they'd somehow look blue like and chill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mention another engagement they felt it their duty to fill;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For&mdash;now I am only a convict, there's no harm in telling the truth&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My home was a fearful wet blanket to blood that was seasoned with youth!<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Not one blessèd thing that was cheerful; no festivals, frolics, or games;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No novels of any description&mdash;'twas wicked to mention their names!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My story-books suddenly vanished, my checker-boards never would keep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No newspaper came through <i>our</i> doorway unless it was first put to sleep!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as for love&mdash;well, that old song, sir, is very melodious and fine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With "No place like home" in the chorus&mdash;I hope there ain't many like mine!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And so, soon my body got hating a place which my soul couldn't abide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Pleasure was all the time smiling, and motioning me to her side;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when I start out on a journey, I'm likely to go it by leaps,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For good or for bad, I'm no half-way&mdash;I'm one or the other for keeps.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My wild oats flew thicker and faster&mdash;I reaped the same crop that I sowed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now I am going to market&mdash;I'm taking it over the road!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Yes, it grieved my good father and mother to see me so sadly astray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They deeply regretted my downfall&mdash;in a strictly respectable way;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They gave me some more admonition, and sent me off full of advice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wondered to see such a villain from parents so good and precise.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Indeed I have often conjectured, when full of neglect and its smarts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I must have been left on the door-step of their uncongenial hearts!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">My home in the prison is waiting&mdash;it opens up clear to my sight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hard work and no pay-day a-coming, a close cell to sleep in at night.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there I must lie sad and lonesome, with more tribulation than rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wake in the morning with sorrow sharp sticking like steel in my breast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But maybe the strain and the trouble won't quite so much o'er me prevail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As 'twould be to some one who wasn't brought up in a kind of a jail!<br /></span>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Cousin John</span>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We got here safe&mdash;my worthy wife an' me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An' then I looked the village through to see what I could see:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I rode upon the cur'us track with stations all up-stairs;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I walked through Wall Street all its length, an' saw no bulls or bears;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I patronized a red-nosed chap with manners very queer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who hadn't had a thing to eat for somethin' like a year;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I saw the road commissioners to work upon a bridge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A million times as large as that we built at Tompkins' Ridge&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(I'm told that they are makin' it, though maybe that's all fun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To use the coming century, an' hope to get it done)&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When who should up an' grasp my hand, with face of genuine joy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Cousin Jeroboam Jones, my cousin's oldest boy!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I had not seen him years an' years&mdash;no wonder he looked strange;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His face an' form in some respects had undergone a change;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But then there wasn't a chance of doubt that that was him, because,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If not, how should he ever know that I was who I was?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We brushed our old acquaintance up, an' soon was at our ease,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A wanderin' all about the place, as cozy as you please.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">It's nicer far, in foreign towns, than 'tis to be alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To walk with one whose blood proceeds from sources near your own;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sim'lar temp'rature of heart, a sort of family ease,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enables you to work your tongue as lib'ral as you please;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so I found myself quite soon uncommonly at home,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He'd severed somewhat from his kin, an' sort o' lost the run,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he recalled the Stebbinses, when mentioned, one by one;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An' takin' him inside an' out, our family scarcely owns<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A relative more relishin' than Jeroboam Jones.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He's teacher in a Sunday-school, he told me, by the way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which has a room, above a store, that's open every day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"For if," he says, "we come across a child that needs our care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We cannot wait till Sunday comes&mdash;we join 'em then an' there.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An' if you want to see the way our worthy cause is run,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The scholars hadn't come, as yet; the Superintendent, though,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">An' said he joyed to meet a friend of one he loved so well;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An' I talked back; an' for a time our converse did not cease&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A regular three-cornered gush of friendship, love, an' peace.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">An' then he showed me how they run their "grab-bags" an' all such<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(We have the same at home, you know, although not near so much);<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An' then he had some val'ables on numbers that you saw,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With figures correspondin'ly, in envelopes, to draw;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I gin him fifty cents to help a cause I dearly hold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An' drew a velvet hymn-book, with a clasp resemblin' gold!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">My cousin pressed my hand with some congratulatin' jokes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And said, "Ah me! the Stebbinses was always lucky folks!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But after all, their <i>shrewdness</i> is the thing that lets them win."<br /></span>

<span class="i0">I'm very glad you sent that money through,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By Cousin Seth, an' not by mail, as I requested you!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">If Jeroboam Jones had twined his fingers 'round the same.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">An' on its honest branches graft the shoots of their design,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An' make me think they're good because they're relatives of mine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While under those fraternal smiles a robber's frown is hid;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But that's the inappropriate thing that Jeroboam did!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When Cousin Seth the tavern reached whose clerk o'ershadows me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He cried, "Where is my long-lost son I've come so far to see?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An' so, to fill that father's heart with resurrected joy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I twisted 'round with him a bit, to try an' find the boy;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An' comin' where I had the luck that hymn-book for to win,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I opened quietly the door, an' both of us went in.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The Superintendent still was there; he gave a little start,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But welcomed us, apparently, with overflowin' heart;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An' told us all about the work, an' how 'twas gettin' on,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An' how much money those who gave unto the cause had won;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Cousin Seth, though much impressed with what he heard an' saw,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Said he didn't fix the envelopes, an' b'lieved he wouldn't draw.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Just then the door was opened quick, an' with a solemn grin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Young Jeroboam Jones appeared, an' sidled softly in;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An' with him was an older man, who looked enough like me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To've been a reg'lar Stebbins too, so far as one could see;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But slappin' Seth upon the back, I said, "My duty's done,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For this is Jeroboam Jones, your long-lost oldest son!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"My 'long-lost oldest son?'" said he: "he's 'bout as much my son<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As you are the belovèd babe of Gen'ral Washington!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It strikes me that my married life was very much amiss,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If I'm responsible for such a sneakin' face as this!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He's blinded you by his supposed relationship to me:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He's no one I have ever seen, or ever want to see!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">As when a fog above a field the sudden breezes tore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You spied a thousand things you did not even miss before,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So all the facts of this affair, as clear as summer skies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Straightway arranged themselves before my reconstructed eyes:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That these were not veracious men; an' this no Sunday-school;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An' naught was what it seemed, except one old bald-headed fool!<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I held those two deceivers out, with unassisted strength,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An' by the collar shook each one to my arm's farthest length;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They gasped an' danced an' skipped around, without a word to say&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They "put their heads together" in a new an' painful way.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Due ninety dollars fifty cents, an' not a penny less!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I shouted; "an' I'll send you back your hymn-book by express!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When finally in my discourse a breathin' pause occurred,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Superintendent counted out the cash, without a word;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which, with a manner dignified, I coldly repossessed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An', still retainin' Jeroboam, that scamp I thus addressed:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">It's quite the thing to "travel" nowadays<br /></span>

<span class="i0">As mentioned in the papers and in books.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I find, in sifting what few facts I know,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Three ways of realizing things are so:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First, when you're told them in such trusty shape<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That square belief isn't easy to escape.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(There's lots of people&mdash;this town wouldn't hold them&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who don't know much excepting what is told them.)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Second, what you've put on some mental shelf,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By having seen and understood yourself.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(How well we know things witnessed, largely lies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On how much brain there is behind our eyes.)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The third way is the surest and the best<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Though sometimes painful, it must be confessed):<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It's where a truth has whipped the earth with you,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until you <i>feel</i>, from head to foot, 'tis true.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I think, sometimes, when all is said and done,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Feeling is all the senses joined in one.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That travelling shouldn't be measured by the mile.)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But we shall take a little trip, to-morrow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With some spare time that wife's contrived to borrow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To where George Washington laid out a town<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That several centuries won't see tumbled down!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A city which, with all the sneaking sinners<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That come down there to steal their daily dinners,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the human insects hovering nigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such as swarm thick wherever good things lie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And spite of all the bad weeds growing round,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has always <i>some</i> good folks upon the ground,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And so my eldest daughter, Isabel,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who knows Miss Clanc, etc., very well,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Called on her in the progress of a walk,<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I was on my stoop a-restin', on a hazy autumn day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rather drowsy from a dinner that had just been stowed away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And regrettin'&mdash;when old Baker's an' my homestead jined in one.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he wasn't to furnish daughter, an' I wasn't to furnish son,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">So's to have my name continued, 'stead of letting it go down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Josiah Baker junior came a drivin' home from town.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">An' a little ways behind him came that wheel scamp, ridin' hard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An' they both to once alighted, an' come walkin' through the yard;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When, as fate was bound to have it, also came my daughter Belle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From a visit in some neighbor's, lookin' very sweet an' well;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An' they stood there all together&mdash;that 'ere strange, dissimilar three,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An' remained in one position&mdash;lookin' steady down at me.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then Josiah spoke up loudly, in a kind o' sudden pet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"If this gal an' I's to marry, it is time the day was set;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For that one-wheel feller's always 'round here courtin', on the fly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An' they say she rides out with him, in the night-time, on the sly.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Father'll give us board an' victuals, you can give her land an' dower,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wherefore, if she wants to have me, please to set the day an' hour."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then the wheel scamp spoke up quiet, but as if the words he meant,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"<i>I</i> would like to wed your daughter, an' have come for your consent.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She is very dear to me, sir, when we walk or when we ride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, I think, is not unwilling to become my cherished bride.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I can give her love and honor, and I ask of you no dower;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wherefore, please bestow your blessing; <i>we</i> have set the day and hour."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then I might have told my daughter that <i>she</i> now could have the floor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An' remarked that on this question there should be just one speech more;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I rendered my decision in a flame of righteous rage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An' I shouted, "You'd no business for to court or to engage!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This 'ere gal has long been spoke for; an' you'll please to clamber on<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your old hind-wheel of a buggy, an' forevermore be gone!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then he picked up Belle quite sudden, an' made swiftly for the gate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An' I formed a move to stop 'em, but was most perplexin' late;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He had fixed a small side-saddle on his everlastin' wheel,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So that she could ride behind him (clingin' 'round him a good deal);<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An' straight down the Beebe turnpike, like a pair o' birds they flew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Towards a preacher's who had married almost every one he knew.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">An' the whole thing seemed so funny, when I thought of it a while,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I looked 'em both all over, an' then blessed 'em with a smile.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then Josiah Baker junior took his spavined mare for home,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An' 'twas difficult decidin' which indulged the most in foam;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">An' your son an' daughter Wheeler maybe'll take you up behind."<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Back to the old, old homestead!&mdash;isn't it queer!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But stranger things than that have happened here:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The old farm, after giving oil by stream,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Until the world itself would almost seem<br /></span>
<span class="i0">About to lose its progress smooth and true,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And creak upon its axis, first we knew),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Closed business in the twinkling of an eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And every blessed well we had went dry!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then all the oil-springs that my neighbors had<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The example followed&mdash;be it good or bad;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the whole region round here, high and low,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So full of wealth a few short months ago&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And men, to get their circumstances oiled&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is now poor farm-land, pretty nearly spoiled!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The little town a mile away from here,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where we sold eggs and butter many a year,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(And feared the neighbors' hens might over-lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And glut the market some sad Saturday),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From a few grown-up folks, a small child-crop,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A church, post-office, store, and blacksmith shop,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This village grew to be, within a year,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A town of fifteen thousand people clear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It had its banks, its street-cars, and its gas,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And other wonders cities bring to pass;<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Its house-yards sold for twice as much, I know,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As my old farm was worth three years ago.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But floated on a hidden sea of oil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which ebbed away, one evening, on the sly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And left "the city" stranded high and dry.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now the place is crumbling to the gaze&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">No banks, no street-cars, no hotels in town&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">More as it did before it sprung a leak.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Let's bring a small part of the city here.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'm going, on this very day, to send<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For several children such as need a friend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And have them come out here and get some air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With room to turn around, and some to spare."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I wrote some men and women in the city,<br /></span>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
